# Basky
Just a hobby project. I was initially planning on developing it in godot, but ~~the physics felt weird~~ it wasn't **FUN ENOUGH** so I made it in python with pygame. Also because I like torturing myself

### Install Dependencies
```bash
$ pip install pygame
```

### Run the game
```bash
$ python main.py
```
